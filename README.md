# TubeArchiver
**Current Features:**
Simple YouTube video downloader in the highest available resolution

**Features in development**
- Archiving an entire YouTube channel with all its meta data as a Back-up
- Archiving playlists

## Info
Is it the most efficient downloader? Not really, my macbook sounds like a Fighter Jet. But pytubefix did not download
videos the highest resolution even if i hardcoded it that way. So for now im using ffmpeg to ensure highest available resolution.
Pytubefix also has a new update so this "bug" might be already fixed (or maybe I couldn't figure it out the intended way).

## Tech Stack
- Flask, JavaScript, HTML & CSS
- (dependencies) pytubefix, ffmpeg
